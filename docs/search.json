First, let us plot results assuming there would be no interim analysis. The horizontal lines correspond to the futility boundary, the minimal detectable difference (i.e. the hazard ratio we need to observe at the final analysis to be statistically significant), and the hazard ratio for which we specified the sample size to have 80% power at. They grey lines illustrate the hazard ratios we observe at the final analysis using these assumptions, with green lines those trials that would be statistically significant, i.e. land below the red horizontal line. These are 79.9% of trials (an estimate of the power).\n\nplot_empty()\n\n# plot trajectories to final only\nsegments(0, hr, 1, resHR[, 2], col = grey(0.9), lty = 1)\n\n# significant trajectories\nsegments(0, hr, 1, resHR[resHR[, 2] &lt;= mdd_no_interim, 2], col = 3, lty = 1)\n\nhoriz()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we know that by adding a futility interim we reduce trial power, because we erroneously stop some trials that would be statistically significant at the final analysis. But how many? In order to find out we have to filter out those trials for which\n\nthe hazard ratio at the interim analysis is above 1 (i.e. the interim boundary for futility) but\nbelow 0.818, i.e. the minimal detectable difference at the final analysis.\n\n\nplot_empty()\ninter_x &lt;- cutoff / max(cutoff)\naxis(side = 1, at = inter_x[1], labels = c(\"interim\", \"final\")[1])\n\n# all trajectories including interim\nsegments(0, hr, inter_x[1], resHR[, 1], col = grey(0.9), lty = 1)\nsegments(inter_x[1], resHR[, 1], 1, resHR[, 2], col = grey(0.9), lty = 1)\n\n# color the false negatives: stopped at interim but sig at final\nind &lt;- (resHR[, 1] &gt; 1 & resHR[, 2] &lt;= mdd_no_interim)\nsegments(0, hr, inter_x[1], resHR[ind, 1], col = 3, lty = 1)\nsegments(inter_x[1], resHR[ind, 1], 1, resHR[ind, 2], col = 3, lty = 1)\n\nhoriz(vert = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above indicates those 2.2% of trials that would be erronously stopped at the futility interim analysis. This is what is typically called the power loss of the futility interim analysis."

He has also co-founded and co-leads the EFSPI statistical methodology leader group which has 16 members from 16 companies. He regularly interacts with regulators globally on various joint projects.\nKaspar’s research interests are methods to optimize study designs, platform trials, advanced survival analysis, probability of success, estimands and causal inference, and estimation of treatment effects in subgroups.\nKaspar received training and worked as a statistician at the Universities of Bern, Stanford, and Zurich. During his PhD he gained some first experience in clinical research as a part-time statistician at the Swiss Institute for Applied Cancer Research. From 2012 until 2024 he worked at Roche in Basel before joining Merck KGaA in October 2024 (100% home-based) to co-lead its Advanced Biostatistical Science group."
