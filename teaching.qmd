*Summer School on Time-to-Event-Analysis*

Topics will range from practice-oriented to methodological and, e.g., cover an introduction to time-to-event-analysis as well as lectures on clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints, logistic regression with right censored (survival) data and strategies to model survival data beyond proportional hazards model.

Lectures will be given by four well-known authorities on time-to-event
analysis and its application

- *Paul Blanche* (KÃ¸benhavn)
- *Sarah Friedrich* (Augsburg)
- *Kaspar Rufibach* (Basel)
