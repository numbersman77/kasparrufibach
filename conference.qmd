I have contributed to and remain involved in the organization of several conferences in the past.

# [ISCB 2025 in Basel](https://iscb2025.info/)

I co-lead the organizing committee for this conference together with Mouna Akacha from Novartis. See [video](https://youtu.be/FkZtrsmV8Cg).

# [EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop](http://www.efspiworkshop.org)

I lead the organizing committee for this workshop for three issues, 2020-2022.

I have been a member of the scientific and local organizing committee from 2017-2019 and again since 2023.
